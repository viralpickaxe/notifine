        <h4>Basic Notifications</h4>
        <p>These are the most basic type of notification that you can create. notifine comes with 6 different types/colours of notifications. By default the notification will dismiss after 3000ms (or until clicked). If a type is not specified it will create a grey type notification.</p>
        <button class="demo-basic blue">blue</button>
        <button class="demo-basic red">red</button>
        <button class="demo-basic orange">orange</button>
        <button class="demo-basic purple">purple</button>
        <button class="demo-basic green">green</button>
        <button class="demo-basic grey">grey</button>
        <div class="codeblock">
          <span class="grey">$(...).click(function(){</span><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;var notification = Notifine.create(<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;{<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;content : {<br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"title" : <span class="purple">"This is a notification"</span>,<br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"body" : <span class="purple">"This is the body content of a notification."</span><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;},<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;type : <span class="purple">"purple"</span> <span class="grey">// Works for any colour class added</span><br>
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;);<br>
          <span class="grey">});</span>
        </div>
        <p>Notifine.create() also returns a notification data object. Infomation like the id might be important to keep track of incase you want to do things like dismissing a notification from the API.</p>
        <div class="codeblock">
          {<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;id : "0x7r9",<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;content : {<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;title : "This is a notification",<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;body : "This is the body content of a notification."<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;},<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;type : "orange",<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;time : 0,<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;events : {}<br>
          }
        </div>

        <br>

        <h4>Timing Notifications</h4>
        <p>If you do not define a "time" item in the Notifine.create() object, the notification will just self dismiss after 3000ms. Simply set time equal to the amount of miliseconds you want before it dismisses. By setting the time to 0, the notification will not dismiss until it is clicked.</p>
        <button class="demo-timing blue" data-time=2000>I will dismiss after 2 seconds</button>
        <button class="demo-timing blue" data-time=5000>I will dimiss after 5 seconds</button>
        <button class="demo-timing blue" data-time=0>I will not dismiss until clicked</button>
        <div class="codeblock">
          <span class="grey">$(...).click(function(){</span><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;var notification = Notifine.create(<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;{<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;content : {<br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"title" : "This is a notification",<br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"body" : "This is the body content of a notification."<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;},<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;type : "purple",<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;time : <span class="purple">5000</span><br>
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;);<br>
          <span class="grey">});</span>
        </div>

        <br>

        <h4>Event Listner Notifications</h4>
        <p>One of the awesome upsides to using notifine, is that you have access to a few event listeners for individual notifications.</p>
        
        <br>

        <h4>Dismiss/Destroy Notifications</h4>
        <p>As well as using timings or onclick to dismiss notifications, you can use a function. Just call Notifine.dismiss(notificationid) with a notificationid (the 5 character long string that gets returned from Notifine.create()).</p>
        <button class="demo-dismiss blue" data-action="create">Create Notification</button>
        <button class="demo-dismiss blue" data-action="dismiss">Dismiss Notification</button>
        <div class="codeblock">
          Notifine.dismiss(<span class="purple">"0x7r9"</span>);<br>
          <span class="grey">// Does the same thing as Notifine.destroy("0x7r9");</span>
        </div>
